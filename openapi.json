Orphanet database (www.orpha.net). Each clinical entity (disorder, group of disorders, or subtype of a disorder) is associated with a unique numerical identifier named ORPHAcode, as well as a preferred term, synonyms, and a definition.\n\nIn the frame of the RD-CODE project, co-funded by the European Union\u2019s Third Health Program, Orphanet developped this API. It intends to support Member States in the implementation of the ORPHA nomenclature to rare diseases-specific codification systems. Starting with countries that have no systematic implementation of the Orpha codification yet, but that are actively committed already in doing so, this project will provide a sufficient real-world implementation experience to be captured by other countries in the future.\n\nDisclaimers:\n\nThe API arise from the RD-CODE project which has received funding from the European Union in the framework of the Health Program.\n\nThe content of this API represents the views of the author only and is his/her sole responsibility; it cannot be considered to reflect the views of the European Commission and/or the Consumers, Health, Agriculture and Food Executive Agency or any other body of the European Union.
